  <title>IP and network management</title>

	This chapter describes how IP addresses for computer systems in a UCS

	bundle available IP address segments of a network.
	The DNS resolution as well as the assignment of IP addresses via DHCP are
	integrated in UCS, as detailed in <xref linkend="networks:dns"/>
	and <xref linkend="module:dhcp:dhcp"/>.

	Incoming and outgoing network traffic can be restricted via the

  <section id="networks::introduction">
	<title>Network objects</title>

	<para>
	  For example, it is possible to define a network object <emphasis>Workstation network</emphasis>
	  which encompasses the IP addresses from
	  <systemitem class="ipaddress">192.0.2.0</systemitem> to <systemitem class="ipaddress">192.0.2.254</systemitem>. If a Windows computer object is now
	  created and only the network object selected, an internal check is
	  performed for which IP addresses are already assigned and the next
	  free one selected. This saves the administrator having to compile the
	  available addresses manually. If a computer object is removed, the
	  address is automatically reassigned.

	<title>Administration of DNS data with BIND</title>
	<para>
	  UCS integrates BIND for the name resolution via the domain name system
	  (DNS). The majority of DNS functions are used for DNS resolution in

	  for a public name server in principle.

		  such a zone is called a <emphasis>SOA record</emphasis> in DNS terminology.
		</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>

				<emphasis>BIND proxy</emphasis> is the primary name server and uses the DNS standard
				port 53. A second server in the background works on port 7777. If data from the
				internal DNS zones are edited in the LDAP, the zone file on the second server is
				updated based on the LDAP information and transmitted to the BIND proxy by means of
				a zone transfer.
			  </para>

			<listitem>
			  <para>
				Samba 4 provides an Active Directory domain. Active Directory is
				closely connected with DNS, for DNS updates of Windows clients or
				the localization of NETLOGON shares among other things. If Samba 4
				is used, the domain controller in question is switched over to the
				use of the <emphasis>Samba backend</emphasis>.
				The DNS database is maintained in
				Samba's internal <acronym>LDB</acronym> database, which Samba updates directly. BIND
				then accesses the Samba DNS data via the <acronym>DLZ</acronym> interface.
			  </para>
			</listitem>
		  </itemizedlist>

		<para>
		  When using the Samba backend, a search is performed in the LDAP for every DNS request.
		  With the OpenLDAP backend, a search is only performed in the directory service if the DNS
		  data has changed. The use of the LDAP backend can thus result in a reduction of the system
		  load on Samba 4 systems.
		</para>
		<para>
		  The backend is configured via the &ucsUCRV; <envar>dns/backend</envar>. The DNS
		  administration is not changed by the backend used and is performed via
		  &ucsUMC; in both cases.

	  <title>User authentication on the proxy</title>
	  <para>
		It is sometimes necessary to restrict web access to certain users. Squid allows
		user-specific access regulation via group memberships. To allow verification of group
		membership, it is necessary for the user to authenticate on the proxy server.
	  </para>

	  <caution>
		<para>
		To prevent unauthorized users from opening websites nonetheless, additional measures are
		required to prevent these users from bypassing the proxy server and accessing the
		Internet. This can be done, for example, by limiting all HTTP traffic through a firewall.
		</para>
	  </caution>

	  <para>
		The proxy authentication (and as a result the possible verification of the group
		memberships) must firstly be enabled. There are three possible mechanisms for this:

	  	<itemizedlist>
	  	  <listitem><simpara>
			Direct authentication against the LDAP server. This is done by setting the &ucsUCRV;
			<envar>squid/basicauth</envar> to <literal>yes</literal> and restarting Squid.
	  	  </simpara></listitem>

	  	  <listitem><simpara>
			Authentication is performed via the NTLM interface. Users logged in on a Windows client
			then do not need to authenticate themselves again when accessing the proxy. NTLM
			authentication is enabled by setting the &ucsUCRV; <envar>squid/ntlmauth</envar> to
			<literal>yes</literal> and restarting Squid.
	  	  </simpara></listitem>

	  	  <listitem><simpara>
			Authentication is performed via Kerberos. Users logged in on a Windows client which is a
			member of a Samba 4 domain authenticate themselves on the proxy with the ticket that
			they received when they logged in to the domain. The
			<package>univention-squid-kerberos</package> package must be installed on every proxy
			server for it to be possible to enable Kerberos authentication. Then the &ucsUCRV;
			<envar>squid/krb5auth</envar> must be set to <literal>yes</literal> and Squid
			restarted.
	  	  </simpara></listitem>
	  	</itemizedlist>
	  </para>

	  <para>
		If NTLM is used an NTLM authentication is performed for every HTTP query as standard. If for example the
		website <uri>https://www.univention.de/</uri> is opened, the subpages and images are loaded in
		addition to the actual HTML page. The NTLM authentication can be cached per domain: If the
		&ucsUCRV; <envar>squid/ntlmauth/keepalive</envar> is set to <literal>yes</literal>, no
		further NTLM authentication is performed for subsequent HTML queries in the same
		domain. In case of problems with local user accounts it may help to set this variable to <literal>no</literal>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		In the standard setting all users can access the proxy. The &ucsUCRV;
		<envar>squid/auth/allowed_groups</envar> can be used to limit the proxy access to one or
		several groups. If several groups are specified, they must be separated by a semicolon.

		The <package>RADIUS</package> app increases the security for UCS managed IT infrastructures by
		controlling the access to the wireless network for users, groups and endpoint
		devices via <ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS">RADIUS
		protocol</ulink>. The configuration is done via black and white lists and
		directly at user, group and endpoint device objects in the UCS management
		system. Registered users are authenticated with their usual domain credentials,
		which, among others, also allows bring your own device concepts.

			  <package>RADIUS</package> is available through the App Center (see <xref linkend="software:appcenter"/>)
			and can be installed using the corresponding &ucsUMC; module App Center. It can be

			points) can contact via RADIUS to check network access requests.
