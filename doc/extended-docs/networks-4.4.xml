            <title>Cascading of proxies</title>
			<para>
			  In some scenarios, cascading of proxy servers may be required. In such a setup,
			  individual proxy servers access logically superordinate proxy servers when web
			  sites are opened, which then fetch the requested data from the Internet. This allows
			  creation of a hierarchical structure of proxy servers and, for example, the operation of a
			  central cache in a company's headquarters that the proxy servers at the individual
			  company sites can access.
			</para>

			<para>
			  The superordinate proxy server is referred to as a <emphasis>parent proxy</emphasis>
			  The parent proxy can be specified via the &ucsUCR; variables
			  <envar>squid/parent/host</envar> (IP address or hostname) and
			  <envar>squid/parent/port</envar> (port number).
			</para>

			<para>
			  Proxy requests from computers in the proxy server's local network are answered
			  directly and not forwarded to the parent proxy. If additional networks should be
			  excluded from forwarding to the parent proxy, these can be specified via the
			  &ucsUCRV; <envar>squid/parent/directnetworks</envar>. When doing so, the CIDR notation
			  must be used (e.g. 192.0.2.0/24); several networks should be separated by blank spaces.
			</para>
        </section>

        <section id="proxy:transparent">
            <title>Operation as a transparent proxy</title>
			<para>
				It is possible to configure Squid as a transparent proxy.
				This can help avoid configuring the proxy server in all application programs.
				When using a transparent proxy, all unencrypted web queries are automatically rerouted through the proxy server.
			</para>
			<note>
				<simpara>This only works for unencrypted web traffic, not for <systemitem class="protocol">https</systemitem>.</simpara>
			</note>
			<note>
				<simpara>LDAP authentication on the proxy server must not be enabled.</simpara>
			</note>
			<para>
			  The following configuration steps need to be made:

			  <itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>
				  The proxy server must be configured as the default gateway on all clients.
				</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para>
				  The proxy server must be configured to use IP forwarding.
				  <programlisting lang="sh">
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p
				  </programlisting>
				</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para>
				  The &ucsUCRV; <envar>squid/transparentproxy</envar> must be set to
				  <emphasis>yes</emphasis> on the proxy server. After that Univention Firewall and Squid need to be restarted:
				  <programlisting lang="sh">
/etc/init.d/univention-firewall restart
/etc/init.d/squid restart
				  </programlisting>

				  This enables packet filter rules which redirect all queries for the web ports to the proxy server.
