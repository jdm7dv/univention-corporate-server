server_password_change hook scripts

Scripts must have a name matching ^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$ and be executable
Each script will be called (via run-parts) with parameter "prechange"
before the password is changed and then either with "nochange" if the
change failed, or "postchange" if the password was changed.

/etc/machine.secret contains the password currently used.
/etc/machine.secret.old contains the list of previous password prefixed by timestamp.
